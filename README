Hello guys !
This is my university graduation project.
Well, what this project is all about is, it's an experimental
application for kids where they can learn how to read and write.

This project makes use of Audio Fingerprinting (Similar to Shazam) and
Handwriting recognition.

This entire project consists of 3 applications:
- Client application
- Application for teachers where they can manage school data
- Server based application to manage databases

I will upload each of them one by one lol !

Have fun and please let me know, if any enquiries.

This project was built using MS Visual Studio 2013 using C# and Java(for
Audio Fingerprinting part). Database was done using MySQL.
